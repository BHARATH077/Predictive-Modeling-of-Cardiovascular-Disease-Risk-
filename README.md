# Step 1 - Data Loading, Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objectives
- Load and explore the Kaggle Heart Disease dataset.
- Perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct initial EDA and visualize relationships.

## Steps Performed
1. Installed required libraries (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.).
2. Loaded dataset into a DataFrame.
3. Removed duplicates and standardized column names.
4. Explored feature statistics and correlation.
5. Visualized:
   - Target distribution
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Feature pair relationships
6. Saved the cleaned dataset to `data/heart_cleaned.csv`.
